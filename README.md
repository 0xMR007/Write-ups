# Cybersecurity Write-ups

*ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [Version franÃ§aise disponible ici](README_FR.md)*

Welcome to this GitHub repository! Here I share my **write-ups** for cybersecurity platforms like **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and others.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Work on my technical english
- Document the steps I followed to complete different challenges.
- Share my learning process and methodologies.
- Improve my analysis, exploitation, and technical writing skills.
- Provide **detailed write-ups**, including commands, reasoning, and lessons learned.

## Target Platforms
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com)
- Other platforms

## Structure
Each write-up will be placed in a separate folder named after the challenge or machine, and will contain:
- A `.md` file explaining the steps.
- Any scripts or files used during the resolution.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational purposes only**. Do not reproduce any of these techniques without explicit legal authorization.

## Note on IP Addresses
Please note that the IP addresses shown in the write-ups may differ from one session to another. This is because I donâ€™t always complete the challenges in one go â€” machines are relaunched, and dynamic IPs are reassigned each time.
Focus on the methodology, not the exact IP addresses. Always check the current IP assigned to your instance when following the steps.

*Happy learning and (ethical) hacking!*
