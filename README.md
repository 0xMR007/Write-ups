# Cybersecurity Write-ups

*ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [Version franÃ§aise disponible ici](README_FR.md)*

Welcome to this GitHub repository! Here I share my **write-ups** for cybersecurity platforms like **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and others.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Work on my technical english
- Document the steps I followed to complete different challenges.
- Share my learning process and methodologies.
- Improve my analysis, exploitation, and technical writing skills.
- Provide **detailed write-ups**, including commands, reasoning, and lessons learned.

## Target Platforms
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com)
- Other platforms

## Structure
Each write-up will be placed in a separate folder named after the challenge or machine, and will contain:
- A `.md` file explaining the steps.
- Any scripts or files used during the resolution.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational purposes only**. Do not reproduce any of these techniques without explicit legal authorization.
